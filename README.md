## Setup

Check out the Guide_V1.4.txt for a detailed description written by yixiwinston.

In general, the application can only be used if you play in borderless window or windowed. Notice that the hotkeys will block your inputs. For example, the original hotkeys are set on F2 ~ F5. Which means if you have the counter active, you won't be able to revive a fallen player in your party with F2 ~ F4. In game commands on F5 won't be possible to trigger eighter, so you might need to use F6 in case of a freeze or emotes.

To dodge this block, you can use the *.exe-files set with the num pad keys. Check the file/ directory names for this matter.

If you want to adapt these hotkeys to your own liking, take the *.ahk-files and change the corresponding keys. If you are not familiar with AutoHotKey, check the instruction file (ToDo).

## Original Author

The original timer was written by @yixiwinston (Discord ID), I only adapted it to my own usage and would like to share it as well. I put all the original files in an extra folder, so there won't be any confusions.

## Adaptations Author

Additional files were written/ edited by me. If you have any questions or some sort of critique, message me on Discord @phantomdance.

## Language

The timers are written in/ with the help of AutoHotKey. If you wish to create an own version of the timers, take the *.ahk-files. To create an *.exe-file you will probably need to download AutoHotKey.
