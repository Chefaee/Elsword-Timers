Guide:

//============================================================================
Note:

The counters defaulted AlwaysOnTop.
and the counters can only using in NoBorderWindow or Window mode, Full-screen mode can't be use(I don't find the method:3)

The counter will block your elsword button.
For example:
"Freeze" is set on "F5", so your elsword's "F5"  will be blocked.
(I suggest that if you wanna call you team that you have freezed by sound, you can just press "F5"+"F6". 
The result will be that "you will count the freeze" and "you call your team by elsword's "F6" ")

The three counters are all set up the Quick-start, So just Press "F2" when openning:3

All timing should start [immediately upon the move's activation] if you wanna count correctly.
For example: 
"Freeze" should start timing right after it is triggered, 
when the screen zooms out for Thorns, 
when Orb Shield zooms out, 
or when Black & White zooms out...

Regarding the 156R3, 
The seconds added for using an ultimate to block another ultimate will reset automatically, so just press the corresponding key when the mechanism is triggered.

156R3 counter have set the second Quick-Start when you press "F2" second time.
Normally, pressing "F2" second time is when the first OrbShield trigged, 
we observed that BlackWhite will be trigged in 77s ,not 80s after first OrbShield.so set the 77s for first BlackWhite
Just first ultimate have this situation, please use this carefully:3

The source codes are included, If you want to change the hotkey you can just modify it as you like. 

The instructions are written very simply.
